          Yes, I did a version of this recipe for project 1, but now I have a new,
          improved and tastier version I've come up with through trial and error.
          I mean who doesn't appreciate a fresh loaf of bread? Homemade with no
          sugar or butter, but still extremely soft and super easy to make. If you
          don't have anything? You'll only need to go to the store and buy seven items
          and you're set to make not one, but a few batches of this lovely bread.
          Not to mention a loaf of bread nowadays is incredibly expensive.

          <p class="steps">
          In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over barely warm water. Beat in honey,
          oil, 1 egg, 2 egg yolks (set the whites aside in a small container),
          and salt. Add the flour one cup at a time, beating after each addition,
          graduating to kneading with hands as dough thickens. Knead until smooth and
          elastic and no longer sticky, adding flour as needed. Cover with a damp clean
          cloth and let rise for 1 1/2 hours or until dough has doubled in bulk.</p>

          <img src="images/challah3.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="steps">
             Punch down the risen dough and turn out onto floured board. Knead for five
              minutes or so, adding flour as needed to keep from getting sticky. Divide dough
              into sections (strands for braid) the number depending on what kind of challah you want to
              make. Roll into long snake about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Pinch the ends of the
              snakes together firmly and braid(refer to TODO: link to braid styles) Either
              leave as braid or form into a round braided loaf by bringing ends together,
              curving braid into a circle, pinch ends together. Grease two baking trays and
              place finished braid or round on each. Cover with towel and let rise about one
              hour. </p>

          <p class="steps" >
            Preheat oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C).
            Beat the remaining egg and brush a generous amount over each braid. Bake at
            375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 20 minutes. Then pull out and cover
            with aluminium foil. Bake for another 7-10 minutes. Bread should have a nice
            hollow sound when thumped on the bottom. Cool on a rack for at least one hour
            before slicing.</p>
