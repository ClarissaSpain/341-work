              <li>Claire Spain is a student (and appreciator of bread) at the University of Montana.
              She enjoys Media Arts, playing video games and baking.</li>
              <li>She chose this project as her instructable, as she likes to think
                of herself as a master at baking challah and she could focus on her
                web-dev skills, instead of worrying about her recipe.</li>
              <li>Challah (however, goes by many names) is predominantly used in
              Sabbath from the religion; Judism. Before the fall of the Temple Rabis requested 1/24 from
              homebakers and 1/48 from professional bakers to be donated from the dough to the
              priests. Since the fall of the Temple, same fractions are instead put in foil
              and burned in fires out of respect. Claire isn't an expert in Judism, but she respects
              their culture (their delicious bread), and beliefs.
