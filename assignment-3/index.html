      <blockquote>"Traditional egg bread for the Jewish Sabbath. You can add 1 cup</br>
      raisins or golden raisins to the dough just before shaping and then </br>
      make the loafs into round braids for Rosh Hashanah."</br>

    <h3 align="left">Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul align="left">
        <li>2 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>8 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3 align="left">Directions:</h3>
      <ol align="left">
        <li>In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over barely warm water. Beat in <ins>honey, oil, 2 eggs, and salt.</ins> Add</br>
        the flour one cup at a time, beating after each addition, graduating to kneading with hands as </br>
        dough thickens. Knead until smooth and elastic and no longer sticky, adding flour as needed. </br>
        Cover with a damp clean cloth and let rise for 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> hours or until dough has doubled in bulk.</br></li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and turn out onto floured board. Divide in half and knead each </br>
          half for five minutes or so, adding flour as needed to keep from getting sticky. Divide each half</br>
          into thirds and roll into long snake about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter. Pinch the ends of the three</br>
          snakes together firmly and braid from middle. Either leave as braid or form into a round</br>
          braided loaf by bringing ends together, curving braid into a circle, pinch ends together. Grease</br>
          two baking trays and place finished braid or round on each. Cover with towel and let rise about</br>
          one hour.</br></li>
        <li>Preheat oven to <b>375</b> degrees F (<b>190</b> degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat the remaining egg and brush a generous amount over each braid. Sprinkle with poppy</br>
           seeds if desired.</br></li>
        <li>Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about <b>40</b> minutes. Bread should have a nice hollow</br>
           sound when thumped on the bottom. Cool on a rack for at least one hour before slicing.</br></li>

  <!-- Somebody commented on the website a way to enhance this Challah recipe-->
  <!-- I have made this before, but just yesterday figured out how to make it perfect.-->
  <!-- I halved the recipe and and altered it as follows: (1) I used an entire packet of -->
  <!--rapid rise yeast instead of 1 1/2 tsp [this means you have to reduce proof time by -->
  <!--about a half], (2) I used 1/2 cup of honey instead of 1/4 cup [Mmm!], (3) I used one-->
  <!--whole egg plus three yokes [this gives it a much more challah-like taste], (4) I added-->
  <!--about a tablespoon of honey to the eggwash, and (5) I reduced baking time by about 6 or 7-->
  <!-- minutes, making sure to cover the challah with foil after about the first 20 minutes, to-->
  <!-- prevent too much browning. This came out magnificently and I suggest these alterations to -->
  <!--anyone who likes a slightly sweeter and eggier challah!-->
