    <br />
As I came to the edge of the woods,<br />
Thrush music -- hark!<br />
Now if it was dusk outside,<br />
Inside it was dark.<br />
</P>
<p>
Too dark in the woods for a bird<br />
By sleight of wing<br />
To better its perch for the night,<br />
Though it still could sing.<br />
</P>
<P>
The last of the light of the sun<br />
That had died in the west<br />
Still lived for one song more<br />
In a thrush's breast.<br />
</P>
<P>
Far in the pillared dark<br />
Thrush music went --<br />
Almost like a call to come in<br />
To the dark and lament.<br />
</P>
<P>
But no, I was out for stars;<br />
I would not come in.<br />
I meant not even if asked;<br />
And I hadn't been.<br />
</p>
