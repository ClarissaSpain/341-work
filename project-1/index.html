  <p>
    <br /> As I came to the edge of the woods,
    <br /> Thrush music --
    <b>hark!</b>
    <br /> Now if it was dusk outside,
    <br /> Inside it was dark.
    <br />
  </P>
  <p>
    Too dark in the woods for a bird
    <br /> By sleight of wing
    <br /> To better its perch for the night,
    <br /> Though it still could sing.
    <br />
  </P>
  <P>
    The last of the light of the sun
    <br /> That had died in the west
    <br /> Still lived for one song more
    <br /> In a thrush's breast.
    <br />
  </P>
  <P>
    Far in the pillared dark
    <br /> Thrush music went --
    <br /> Almost like a call to come in
    <br /> To the dark and lament.
    <br />
  </P>
  <P>
    But no, I was out for stars;
    <br /> I would not come in.
    <br /> I meant not even if asked;
    <br /> And I hadn't been.
    <br />
